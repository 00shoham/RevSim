* Add advertising to the model.
  - spend monthly and/or cost per impression
  - make a number of impressions, randomly across customers, prospects
  - high attrition rate / low engagement rate
  - start and end date for a campaign
  - escalate some non-customer, non-PFO customers into the sales pipeline
  - no weekends, holidays.

* Add support for launch date for products, so we can simulate future
  product launches (not at simulation start time/date).

* Check that RandomRepFromClassList does not fail if first attempt
  is too busy

* Add income tax expenses.  Probably just post-process the annual revenue
  and inject quarterly tax payments.  Need config to work out tax rates
  based on levels of revenue.

* How do we model B2B2C business?  i.e., sign up partners, and they
  bring in end customers?
