* Simulate initial revenue per product.

* Add support for launch date for products, so we can simulate future
  product launches (not at simulation start time/date).

* Check that RandomRepFromClassList does not fail if first attempt
  is too busy

* Add income tax expenses.  Probably just post-process the annual revenue
  and inject quarterly tax payments.  Need config to work out tax rates
  based on levels of revenue.

* Add support for cashflow modeling:
  - initial cash on hand
  - investment events
  - subsidy events
  - tax instalment payments (as above)
  - the rest is already modeled
  - separate output file?

* How do we model revenue that comes in via a marketing spend plus
  self-service enrollment?  i.e., B2C business.

* How do we model B2B2C business?  i.e., sign up partners, and they
  bring in end customers?
