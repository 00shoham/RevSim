To build this you also need a copy of IdanLib

  https://github.com/00shoham/idanlib/

Check out that first, and in the src/ folder run Make.

IdanLib also has dependencies:
  - lua
  - libcurl
  - uuid

On Ubuntu and similar Linux distributions, you run:

  sudo apt install liblua5.3-dev uuid-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev

You can then build both IdanLib and RevSim.  You may have to 
modify the Makefile in RevSim/src to point to the correct src/
folder of your check-out of IdanLib.
