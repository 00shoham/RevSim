# RevSim
Revenue simulator for small companies conducting B2B business with a sales team and generating monthly recurring revenue.

It is intended to simulate sales activity, including cost of sales
and both deals and revenue generated from that activity.

A configuration file specifies the simulation parameters, and you run
the simulator to generate time series of costs, events and income.

The model focuses on B2B businesses that require a multi-stage sales
process conducted by human account managers to close new business. It
is designed for businesses that generate monthly recurring revenue
from customers.

There are lots of other business models - for now, this simulator does
not handle any of them.  Feel free to enhance it or discuss feature ideas!
